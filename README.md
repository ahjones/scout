Data science homework project

I've added a simple script to read the training data. I tried to use
Pandas to read the CSV but it struggled with the '\n's in the body of
the text.

The Python CSV module seems to be OK with it, but the UTF8 handing in
Python 2 isn't much to write home about.

I'm now going to try to load the array into Scikit.
